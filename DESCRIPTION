Description: This pacakge is written for annotating regions such as
    ChIPseq peaks, histone marks or simply a genomic regions with nearest
    genes. It is written with focus on compact genomes such fungi and 
    bacteria where intergenic space is very small (1-2kb) and ChIPseq 
    peaks in tandem or divergent intergenic spaces or overlapping genes
    may result in false positive when existing methods like ChIPpeakAnno
    or ChIPseeker are used.
