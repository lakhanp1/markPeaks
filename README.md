# markPeaks
This pacakge is written for annotating regions such as ChIPseq peaks, histone 
marks or simply a genomic regions with nearest genes. It is written with focus 
on compact genomes such fungi and bacteria where intergenic space is very small 
(1-2kb) and ChIPseq peaks in tandem or divergent intergenic spaces or 
overlapping genes may result in false positive when existing methods like
ChIPpeakAnno or ChIPseeker are used.
